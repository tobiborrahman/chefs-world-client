							<p className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">
								In react, there are two types of components:
								uncontrolled and controlled. The main difference

								state. <br /> <br />
								<span className="text-white font-bold">
									Uncontrolled Components:
								</span>{' '}
								Uncontrolled components are a simpler and less
								verbose way of handling form input in React.
								With uncontrolled components, the state of the
								input is managed by the DOM itself. This means
								that the input's value is not stored in the
								component's state, but rather in the DOM node's
								value property. The component does not have
								direct control over the input's value, and
								therefore, there is no need to update the state
								every time the input value changes. Uncontrolled
								components can be used when the input data does
								not need to be validated or when the component
								needs to be initialized with a default value.
								<br /> <br />
								<span className="text-white font-bold">
									controlled Components:
								</span>
								Controlled components are components that are
								explicitly tied to a piece of state in the
								component's state. This means that every time
								the input value changes, the component's state
								is updated accordingly. This allows the
								component to have full control over the input's
								value and enables data validation and
								manipulation. Controlled components are often
								used when input data needs to be validated or
								when the component needs to respond to user
								input in real-time.

								How to validate React props using PropTypes
							</h3>
							<p className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">
								Props and PropTypes are important mechanisms for
								passing read-only attributes between React
								components. We can use React props, short for
								properties, to send data from one component to
								another. If a component receives the wrong type
								of props, it can cause bugs and unexpected
								errors in your app.
								<br /> <br />
								PropTypes is React's internal mechanism for
								adding type checking to component props. React
								components use a special property called
								propTypes to set up type checking, When props
								are passed to a React component, they are
								checked against the type definitions configured
								in the propTypes property.
								<br />
								You can also use the prop-types library in react
								to validate prop types.

							<p className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">
								Node.js and Express.js are both popular
								JavaScript technologies for building web

								Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on
								Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows you to
								run JavaScript code outside of a browser
								environment, and it provides a number of
								built-in modules for common tasks such as
								working with the file system, networking, and
								cryptography.
								<br />
								Express.js, on the other hand, is a lightweight
								web framework built on top of Node.js. It
								provides a set of features for building web
								applications such as handling HTTP requests and
								responses, routing, middleware, and templating.

								What is a custom hook, and why will you create a
								custom hook?
							</h3>
							<p className="text-gray-300 font-semibold">
								A custom hook in React is a function that allows
								you to extract and reuse logic that is commonly
								used across components. Custom hooks are created
								using the same basic rules as React's built-in
								hooks, but they can have any name and can use
								other hooks as well. <br />
								Here are some reasons why you might want to
								create a custom hook:
								<br /> <br />
								<span className="text-white font-bold">
									Reusability:
								</span>{' '}
								Custom hooks can help you reuse logic across
								components. For example, if you have a set of
								functions that you use across multiple
								components, you can extract them into a custom
								hook and reuse it wherever you need it. <br />{' '}
								<span className="text-white font-bold">
									Code organization:
								</span>{' '}
								Custom hooks can help you organize your code and
								make it easier to maintain. By extracting
								reusable logic into a separate file, you can
								keep your components clean and focused on their
								specific responsibilities. <br />{' '}
								<span className="text-white font-bold">
									Abstraction:
								</span>{' '}
								Abstraction: Custom hooks can abstract complex
								logic into a simple interface that can be used
								by other components. This can make your code
								more modular and easier to reason about. <br />
								<span className="text-white font-bold">
									Testing:
								</span>{' '}
								Custom hooks can be easily tested in isolation,
								which can help you ensure that your code is
								working as expected.
